# ROLA (Radix Off-Ledger Authentication)

ROLA is a method of authenticating something claimed by the user connected to your dApp with the Radix Wallet. It uses the capabilities of the Radix Network to make this possible in a way that is decentralized and flexible for the user.

ROLA is intended for use in the server backend portion of a Full Stack dApp. It runs "off-ledger" alongside backend business and user management logic, providing reliable authentication of claims of user control using "on-ledger" data from the Radix Network.
